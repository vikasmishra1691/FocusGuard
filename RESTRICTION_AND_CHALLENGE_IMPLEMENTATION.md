# Restriction and Challenge Mechanism Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the app restriction and mathematical challenge system in FocusGuard. When users exceed their usage limits, they are immediately blocked and must solve arithmetic problems to earn extra time.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Usage Tracking** - Uses UsageStatsManager API to track actual app usage
2. **Automatic Blocking** - Immediately blocks apps when limits are exceeded
3. **Challenge System** - Presents math questions to earn extra time
4. **Extra Time Management** - Stores and tracks earned bonus time in database
5. **Persistent Storage** - All data saved in Room database

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Layer

#### New Entity: `EarnedExtraTime`
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/data/model/FocusGuardEntities.kt`

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "earned_extra_time")
data class EarnedExtraTime(
    @PrimaryKey
    val id: String, // Format: packageName_YYYY-MM-DD
    val packageName: String,
    val date: String,
    val extraMinutesEarned: Int = 0,
    val extraMinutesUsed: Int = 0,
    val lastUpdated: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
) {
    fun getRemainingExtraTime(): Int = maxOf(0, extraMinutesEarned - extraMinutesUsed)
}
```

**Purpose**: Tracks extra time earned from completing challenges for each app per day.

#### New DAO: `EarnedExtraTimeDao`
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/data/dao/FocusGuardDao.kt`

**Key Methods**:
- `getExtraTimeForDate()` - Retrieve earned time for specific app/date
- `addExtraMinutes()` - Add earned time when challenge completed
- `useExtraMinutes()` - Deduct time as it's consumed
- `insertExtraTime()` - Create new record

### 2. Repository Layer

#### SettingsRepository Extensions
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/SettingsRepository.kt`

**New Methods Added**:
```kotlin
suspend fun addEarnedExtraTime(packageName: String, date: String, minutes: Int)
suspend fun getRemainingExtraTime(packageName: String, date: String): Int
suspend fun useExtraTime(packageName: String, date: String, minutes: Int)
```

### 3. Business Logic Layer

#### AccessTimeManager - Core Helper Method
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/AccessTimeManager.kt`

**Key Method: `isAppUsageLimitExceeded()`**
```kotlin
suspend fun isAppUsageLimitExceeded(packageName: String): Boolean {
    val monitoredApp = settingsRepository.getMonitoredApp(packageName) ?: return false
    
    // Get current usage from UsageStatsManager (real-time data)
    val currentUsageMillis = usageStatsHelper.getAppUsageTime(packageName)
    val currentUsageMinutes = (currentUsageMillis / 60000).toInt()
    
    // Get earned extra time
    val extraTime = settingsRepository.getRemainingExtraTime(packageName, today)
    
    // Calculate effective limit (base limit + remaining extra time)
    val effectiveLimit = monitoredApp.dailyLimitMinutes + extraTime
    
    return currentUsageMinutes >= effectiveLimit
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. Fetches real-time usage from Android UsageStatsManager
2. Retrieves any earned extra time from database
3. Calculates effective limit = base limit + extra time
4. Returns true if usage ≥ effective limit

**Enhanced `checkAppAccess()` Method**:
- Now uses real-time usage data instead of cached stats
- Includes extra time in calculations
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 4. Service Layer

#### FocusGuardAccessibilityService
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/FocusGuardAccessibilityService.kt`

**Enhanced Monitoring**:
```kotlin
private suspend fun handleAppLaunch(packageName: String) {
    // First check if usage limit is already exceeded
    val limitExceeded = accessTimeManager.isAppUsageLimitExceeded(packageName)
    
    if (limitExceeded) {
        // Increment blocked attempts counter
        // Block the app immediately with challenge screen
        blockApp(packageName, accessResult)
        return
    }
    
    // Continue with normal access checks...
}
```

**Periodic Session Monitoring**:
- Checks every 5 seconds if active sessions have exceeded limits
- Automatically ends sessions when limits reached
- Next launch attempt will trigger blocking screen

**Usage Statistics Sync**:
- Runs every 30 seconds
- Syncs real usage data from UsageStatsManager
- Updates database with accurate usage information

### 5. UI Layer

#### BlockerActivity
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/example/focusguard/BlockerActivity.kt`

**Challenge Flow**:

1. **Challenge Presentation**:
   - Shows app name and block reason
   - Displays randomly generated math question
   - Difficulty adjusts based on user's attempts

2. **Answer Submission**:
```kotlin
lifecycleScope.launch {
    if (challenge.isCorrect) {
        // Grant extra time and store it
        val earned = accessTimeManager.grantExtraTime(packageName, challenge)
        
        // Store the earned extra time in database
        settingsRepository.addEarnedExtraTime(packageName, today, earned)
        
        // Record challenge completion
        settingsRepository.recordChallenge(challenge.copy(timeEarnedMinutes = earned))
        
        timeEarned = earned
        isCorrect = true
    } else {
        // Record failed challenge
        settingsRepository.recordChallenge(challenge)
        isCorrect = false
    }
}
```

3. **Success Flow**:
   - User earns 5 minutes (configurable)
   - Time is stored in database
   - User can continue to the app
   - Blocker closes and app opens

4. **Failure Flow**:
   - Shows correct answer
   - User can try again immediately with new question
   - Failed attempts are recorded for analytics

---

## User Flow Example

### Scenario: User opens Instagram after exceeding daily limit

1. **App Launch Detected**
   - FocusGuardAccessibilityService detects Instagram launch
   - Calls `handleAppLaunch("com.instagram.android")`

2. **Limit Check**
   - Calls `isAppUsageLimitExceeded("com.instagram.android")`
   - Retrieves: 65 minutes used today, 60 minute limit, 0 extra time
   - Result: EXCEEDED (65 >= 60)

3. **Immediate Block**
   - BlockerActivity launches with fullscreen overlay
   - Instagram is sent to background
   - User sees: "You've reached your limit for Instagram!"

4. **Challenge Presented**
   - Shows math question: "127 + 89 = ?"
   - User has input field to enter answer

5. **User Answers Correctly**
   - Answer: 216 ✓
   - System grants 5 extra minutes
   - Database updated: extra_time_earned = 5
   - Message: "Correct! You earned 5 minutes!"

6. **App Access Granted**
   - User clicks "Continue to App"
   - BlockerActivity closes
   - User can now use Instagram
   - New effective limit: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes

7. **Next Launch (after using 3 more minutes)**
   - Usage: 68 minutes
   - Extra time remaining: 5 - 3 = 2 minutes
   - Effective limit: 60 + 2 = 62 minutes
   - Result: Still EXCEEDED (68 >= 62)
   - User must solve another challenge

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Time Earned Per Challenge**: 5 minutes (can be configured in settings)
- **Challenge Difficulty**: 2 (scale 1-5)
- **Retry Delay**: Immediate (user can try again right away)
- **Difficulty Increase**: +1 per failed attempt in same session

### Customizable Parameters

In `SettingsRepository`:
```kotlin
val DEFAULT_TIME_EARNED = intPreferencesKey("default_time_earned") // Default: 10
val CHALLENGE_DIFFICULTY = intPreferencesKey("challenge_difficulty") // Default: 2
```

---

## Database Schema

### Table: earned_extra_time
```sql
CREATE TABLE earned_extra_time (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- "com.instagram.android_2025-10-16"
    packageName TEXT NOT NULL,        -- "com.instagram.android"
    date TEXT NOT NULL,               -- "2025-10-16"
    extraMinutesEarned INTEGER,       -- Total earned from challenges
    extraMinutesUsed INTEGER,         -- Amount consumed
    lastUpdated INTEGER               -- Timestamp
)
```

### Indexes
- Primary key on `id` (packageName_date)
- Query by packageName and date for fast lookups

---

## Logging and Debugging

### Key Log Tags
- **AccessTimeManager**: Usage limit checks, time calculations
- **FocusGuardAccessibility**: App launch detection, blocking events
- **BlockerActivity**: Challenge completion, time grants
- **UsageStatsHelper**: Real-time usage data fetching

### Example Logs
```
AccessTimeManager: Limit check for com.instagram.android: usage=65, limit=60, extraTime=0, effectiveLimit=60, exceeded=true
FocusGuardAccessibility: Usage limit exceeded for Instagram, blocking immediately
BlockerActivity: Challenge completed! Earned 5 minutes for com.instagram.android
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Debouncing**: Events from same app within 1 second are ignored
2. **Coroutine Usage**: All database operations are async
3. **Flow-based Updates**: UI updates automatically when data changes
4. **Efficient Queries**: Single query per check using indexed lookups
5. **Background Processing**: Usage sync runs in background service

### Memory Management
- Service uses SupervisorJob for proper cleanup
- Active sessions map cleared when apps close
- Old database records can be cleaned up periodically

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Increase math difficulty with consecutive challenges
2. **Time Decay**: Extra time expires after certain period
3. **Challenge Types**: Add word puzzles, memory games
4. **Cooldown Period**: Force 1-minute wait after failed attempts
5. **Daily Limits**: Cap total extra time earned per day
6. **Reward System**: Achievements for using less time than limit
7. **Smart Blocking**: Learn user patterns and proactively suggest breaks

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: App not blocking when limit exceeded
**Solution**:
1. Check Accessibility Service is enabled in Settings
2. Verify UsageStatsManager permission granted
3. Check logs for "Limit check" messages
4. Ensure app is in monitored apps list with enabled=true

### Issue: Extra time not being saved
**Solution**:
1. Check database version (should be 3)
2. Verify EarnedExtraTimeDao is registered
3. Check logs for "Challenge completed!" message
4. Query database directly to confirm writes

### Issue: Usage stats not updating
**Solution**:
1. Verify Usage Stats permission granted
2. Check UsageStatsHelper logs
3. Ensure periodic sync is running (every 30 seconds)
4. Try force-stopping and restarting the app

---

## Code Quality

### Architecture Patterns Used
- **Repository Pattern**: SettingsRepository abstracts data access
- **Service Layer**: AccessTimeManager contains business logic
- **MVVM**: MainActivity uses state flows and lifecycle-aware components
- **Dependency Injection**: Manual DI with context-based initialization

### Testing Recommendations
- Unit test `isAppUsageLimitExceeded()` with mock data
- Integration test challenge flow end-to-end
- UI test BlockerActivity challenge interaction
- Performance test with 100+ monitored apps
