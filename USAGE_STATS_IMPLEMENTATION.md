# UsageStatsManager Implementation Guide

## Overview
FocusGuard now uses Android's **UsageStatsManager API** to track real-time app usage. This implementation provides accurate tracking of how long users spend on monitored social media apps.

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### 1. **UsageStatsHelper.kt**
A comprehensive helper class that handles all interactions with Android's UsageStatsManager.

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Check if Usage Stats permission is granted
- ✅ Open Usage Access settings screen
- ✅ Get app usage time for today (in milliseconds)
- ✅ Get app usage time for custom time ranges
- ✅ Get usage stats for multiple apps at once
- ✅ Detect currently running foreground app
- ✅ Detailed usage breakdown for debugging

#### Main Functions:

```kotlin
// Check permission
fun hasUsageStatsPermission(): Boolean

// Open settings to grant permission
fun openUsageAccessSettings()

// Get usage for a specific app today
fun getAppUsageTime(packageName: String): Long

// Get usage for multiple apps
fun getAllAppsUsageToday(packageNames: List<String>): Map<String, Long>

// Get current foreground app
fun getCurrentForegroundApp(): String?
```

### 2. **Automatic Usage Sync in FocusGuardAccessibilityService**

The accessibility service now automatically syncs real usage data every 30 seconds.

#### How it works:
1. Every 30 seconds, the service queries UsageStatsManager
2. Gets actual usage data for all monitored apps
3. Updates the database with real system-tracked usage
4. Logs all updates for debugging

#### Debug logs to watch for:
```
D/FocusGuardAccessibility: Syncing Instagram: 45 minutes
D/FocusGuardAccessibility: Syncing TikTok: 32 minutes
```

---

### 3. **Database Updates**

#### Added new fields to `DailyUsageStats`:
- `sessionsCompleted: Int` - Number of sessions
- `lastUpdated: Long` - Timestamp of last update

#### Database version upgraded to 2 with fallback migration

## 🔧 How to Use

### Step 1: Grant Usage Stats Permission

Users must grant "Usage Access" permission for tracking to work.

**In your app:**
1. Go to setup screen or settings
2. Grant "Usage Stats Permission"
3. This opens: Settings → Special App Access → Usage Access → FocusGuard → Enable

**To check programmatically:**
```kotlin
val usageStatsHelper = UsageStatsHelper(context)
if (!usageStatsHelper.hasUsageStatsPermission()) {
    usageStatsHelper.openUsageAccessSettings()
}
```

---

### Step 2: View Real-Time Usage

Once permissions are granted:
1. **Automatic tracking**: The accessibility service syncs every 30 seconds
2. **Home screen updates**: Usage stats refresh every 30 seconds
3. **Analytics screen**: Shows detailed breakdown of usage

---

## 🎯 What Gets Tracked

### Daily Usage Stats tracked for each app:
- **Total usage time** (minutes) - from UsageStatsManager
- **Number of sessions** - tracked by accessibility service
- **Longest session** - tracked per day
- **Blocked attempts** - when user tries to access over limit
- **Challenges completed/failed** - for bypass attempts

---

## 🔍 Debugging Usage Tracking

### 1. Enable logcat filtering
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "UsageStatsHelper|FocusGuardAccessibility|UsageTrackingService"
```

### 2. Check permission status
```kotlin
val helper = UsageStatsHelper(context)
Log.d("Debug", "Has permission: ${helper.hasUsageStatsPermission()}")
```

### 3. View detailed stats
```kotlin
val helper = UsageStatsHelper(context)
val stats = helper.getDetailedUsageStats()
stats.forEach { stat ->
    Log.d("Debug", "${stat.packageName}: ${stat.totalTimeInForeground}ms")
}
```

### 4. Check database updates
Watch for logs like:
```
D/FocusGuardAccessibility: Syncing Instagram: 45 minutes
D/SettingsRepository: Updating stats for com.instagram.android
```

---

## 📊 Usage Flow

### Real-time tracking flow:
```
User uses Instagram
    ↓
Android tracks usage (system-level)
    ↓
UsageStatsManager stores data
    ↓
FocusGuardAccessibilityService syncs (every 30s)
    ↓
UsageStatsHelper.getAppUsageTime() queries system
    ↓
Database updated with real usage
    ↓
MainActivity displays updated stats (auto-refresh every 30s)
```

---

## 🚀 Key Benefits

### 1. **Accurate Tracking**
- Uses Android's official API
- System-level tracking (can't be bypassed)
- Works even if app is closed

### 2. **Real-time Updates**
- 30-second sync interval
- Auto-refresh in UI
- No manual refresh needed

### 3. **Comprehensive Data**
- Tracks foreground time only
- Per-app breakdown
- Historical data available

### 4. **Battery Efficient**
- Queries system data (lightweight)
- No constant monitoring needed
- Background service is optimized

---

## 🔐 Permissions Required

### AndroidManifest.xml already includes:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS"
    tools:ignore="ProtectedPermissions" />
```

### User must grant manually:
- This is a **special permission**
- Cannot be requested via runtime permission dialog
- Must be granted through Settings

---

## 🎨 UI Integration

### Home Screen shows:
- ✅ Real-time usage for each monitored app
- ✅ Daily limit progress bars
- ✅ Time remaining indicators
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### Analytics Screen shows:
- ✅ Detailed usage breakdown
- ✅ Session history
- ✅ Daily trends
- ✅ Challenge statistics

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No usage data showing"
**Solution:**
1. Check if Usage Stats permission is granted
2. Use some monitored apps first
3. Wait 30 seconds for sync
4. Check logcat for errors

### Issue: "Permission keeps showing as not granted"
**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Special App Access → Usage Access
2. Find FocusGuard and enable it
3. Return to app and wait 2 seconds (auto-refresh)

### Issue: "Usage stats not updating"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure Accessibility Service is enabled
2. Check logcat: `adb logcat | grep FocusGuard`
3. Look for sync logs every 30 seconds
4. Try restarting the accessibility service

## 📖 API Documentation

### UsageStatsManager Query Intervals:
- `INTERVAL_DAILY` - Day-by-day data
- `INTERVAL_WEEKLY` - Week-by-week data
- `INTERVAL_MONTHLY` - Month-by-month data
- `INTERVAL_YEARLY` - Year-by-year data

### Current Implementation Uses:
- **INTERVAL_DAILY** for accurate day tracking
- Queries from midnight (00:00) to current time
- Returns total foreground time in milliseconds

---

## 🔄 Automatic Actions

### When limits are exceeded:
1. **Session limit hit** → BlockerActivity shows challenge
2. **Daily limit hit** → BlockerActivity blocks access
3. **Challenge solved** → Grant extra time (decreasing)
4. **Challenge failed** → Return to home

### System automatically:
- Syncs usage every 30 seconds
- Updates UI every 30 seconds
- Enforces limits in real-time
- Logs all actions for debugging

---
